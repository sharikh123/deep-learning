deep learning introduction:
1.deep learning is defines about the working on complex neural networks. this topic is the ssubset of the machine learning.
types of layers in deep learning:
1.input layer:
receives the raw data to the machine
2.hidden layer:
perform the computations in the hidden layer which is process the data
3.output layer:
provide the final output and prediction on classification

activation functions in deep learning:.

1. ReLu : Rectified liner unit:
which is used to the hidden layers to show the data in the gradients of the data and which is simply used to speed up during the training of the data.
2.sigmoid:
map the values binary (0 and 1 in the layer)
3.softmax:
covert the raw data (score) convert into the probability on the givendata>

back propagation and optimisation:

in this propagation step we use of the example :- mse(means standard error), cross entropy stop: which are optimises the data.
